What is a database?
(1.) A collection of data.
(2.) A method for accessing and manipulating that data.
- A structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface.
- A database is just a bunch of tables. (In a relational database, at least)

SQL:
- Structured Query Language
- The language we use to talk to our databases

Relational Databases that use SQL:
(1.) MySQL
(2.) SQLite
(3.) PostgreSQL
(4.) Oracle
(5.) Many others

Takeaways:
(1.) Once you learn SQL, it's pretty easy to switch to another DB that uses SQL.
(2.) What makes databases (DBMS) unique are the features that they offer, not the language.

Tables:
- Rows
- Columns
- Headers
- Data Types (Numeric Types, String Types, Date Types)
